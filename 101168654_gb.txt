WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION?

The George Brown College Foundation, established in 1984,
is a separately incorporated registered charity that serves
 as the primary fundraising vehicle for George Brown College.
 The Foundation is guided by a volunteer Board of Directors
 who support the College’s mandate of increasing access to
 education by raising money to support student success through
scholarships, bursaries and awards.

Together with the college, we work to advance George Brown’s
commitment to excellence in teaching, applied learning and innovation, as well as its commitment to access, diversity and mutual respect. Together with our donors, we work to ensure that no student is denied a post-secondary education at George Brown College because of financial constraints.
